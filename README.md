# MovieMetrics: Insights and Predictive Analysis of IMDb Ratings

**MovieMetrics** is a data analytics project focused on understanding the factors that influence IMDb ratings for movies. By leveraging statistical techniques and visualizations, this project explores critical insights into movie success and provides predictive modeling capabilities.

## Overview

The project examines key features of movies, including:
- IMDb scores
- Visual features (e.g., number of faces in posters)
- Other attributes provided in the dataset

It combines exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization to draw actionable insights and identify patterns in movie success.

## Key Features

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizes IMDb score distributions with histograms, density plots, and boxplots.
   - Analyzes other key variables, such as the number of faces in visuals.

2. **Statistical Modeling**:
   - Implements linear regression, ridge regression, and other statistical models to predict IMDb scores.
   - Evaluates the relationships between features and movie success metrics.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Creates engaging visual representations to communicate findings effectively.

## Potential Impact

**For Movie Studios:**
- Identify critical features that correlate with higher IMDb ratings.
- Optimize movie production strategies, such as poster design and promotional material.

**For Data Scientists:**
- Learn advanced statistical techniques and their application in real-world datasets.
- Explore new methods of visualizing and analyzing movie-related data.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: R
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `glmnet` for data manipulation and visualization.
  - `boot`, `psych`, `car` for statistical modeling and diagnostics.
- **Dataset**: IMDb movie data (provided as `IMDB_data_Fall_2024.csv`).
